### a) File Final_NCB_topic_model_upload_script.R

Script for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) /topic modeling  used for the following figures: 

Figure 2d : Schematic overview of topic model fitting method to assess microglia heterogeneity

Figure 7c : Bar graph shows the mean topic score for each program (antigen presentation (AP), secretory, and IFN response) in all microglia from each condition.

Extended Figure 2e:  Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for microglia topic models from Fig 2d with the listed
661 number of topics (K), each fit to an error tol = 10

Extended Figure 2f: Bar plot shows the relative enrichment of each topic in control and metastatic animals from
663 Fig 2d.
